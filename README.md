# Radiance4D

Hybrid real-time rendering and spatiotemporal reconstruction engine featuring 3D/4D Gaussian
Splatting, photogrammetry, ray tracing, and temporal stability.

C++20, built directly on Direct3D 12. Vulkan backend planned.

| Swapchain, frame synchronisation, resize | working |
| Build-time HLSL to DXIL (DXC 1.9.2609) | working |
| Debug layer, DRED, validation counters | working |
| Indexed and non-indexed geometry | working |
| GPU timestamp profiling | working |
| Headless rendering and frame capture | working |
| WARP image-regression tests, CI | working |

| Orbit and free-fly cameras | working |
| glTF loading (cgltf) | working |
| PBR shading, analytic lights | working |
| Base colour, metallic-roughness, normal maps | working |
| ImGui statistics overlay | working |
| Vulkan backend | planned (M3) |
| 3D Gaussian Splatting | planned (M4) |

| Hybrid mesh and Gaussian rendering | planned (M6) |
| Temporal reprojection and denoising | planned (M7) |
| Dynamic 4D Gaussians | planned (M8) |

No performance figures are published yet: there is no benchmark scene and no profiler installed.

## Building

Windows 11, Visual Studio 2022 (v143), CMake 3.26+, a D3D12 GPU. Dependencies are fetched and
hash-pinned by CMake; nothing is installed system-wide.

```
cmake --preset windows-d3d12
cmake --build --preset windows-d3d12-debug
ctest --preset windows-d3d12-debug
```

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Running

```
build/windows-d3d12/bin/Debug/radiance4d_viewer.exe
```

`--scene <file.gltf>`, `--adapter <index|warp|name>`, `--no-vsync`, `--gpu-validation`,
`--frames <n>`, `--resize-cycles <n>`, `--log-level <0..5>`. `--help` lists all flags.
Without `--scene` a built-in material grid is rendered. Esc quits, F1 toggles vsync, F2 switches
camera mode; left mouse orbits, right pans, wheel zooms, WASDQE moves in free-fly. Exit code is non-zero if the
debug layer reported an error.

Headless, no GPU required:

```
radiance4d_viewer.exe --headless --frames 30 --fixed-step 0.0166667 --out frame.png
```
